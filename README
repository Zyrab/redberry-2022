# Redberry Bootcamp Assignment — 2023 & Remake (2025)

This repository contains my original **Redberry Bootcamp assignment** from February 2023, and a **remade version (2025)** built with my own DOM utility library — [Domo](https://github.com/zyrab/domo).

## Background

In 2023, I applied to join the Redberry Bootcamp.  
The assignment was to build a **live CV generator** based on a provided Figma design, with validation and multiple form pages.

At that time, I was new to serious web development. I built everything with plain **HTML + JavaScript**, no modules, no frameworks. For dynamic “pages” I manually hid and showed sections, and for validation I wrote regex-based checks (a bit overcomplicated, but they worked!).

The code wasn’t terrible, but I didn’t finish all requirements. I submitted anyway and was rejected. Still, it was a huge learning step for me.

## The Remake (2025)

Now I’m revisiting this project to rebuild it from scratch, using my current knowledge and **Domo**, a lightweight DOM manipulation library I created.

### Key points of the remake:

- Built with **modular components** (using Domo)
- Real-time **form validation** with cleaner handling
- **Live CV preview**: form on the left, CV preview on the right
- **SPA-style navigation** for multiple form pages
- Future features:
  - Save user inputs with **localStorage** or **sessionStorage** (TBD)
  - Export CV as **PDF**

This isn’t meant to be a polished product — it’s an experiment to test Domo in a real project and see how efficient I can make it without relying on a state manager.
